# NPC Name: Deryan Tavron

**Age:** 45
**Gender:** Male
**Race:** Bav (Human)
**Languages Spoken:** Bav (native), Veden (fluent), Alethi (fluent)

## Physical Description
Deryan is a wiry man of average height with a frame shaped by years of grueling labor. His gait is uneven, with a pronounced limp on his left side, a lingering result of his injury. His breathing is often labored, punctuated by wheezing that grows worse with exertion or in poor air quality. His dark Bav features—bronze-toned skin, thick black hair streaked with gray, and piercing dark brown eyes—are etched with lines of pain and weariness. Despite his diminished physical state, there is a quiet dignity in his posture, as though clinging to the remnants of his former pride.

## Personality
Deryan’s natural intelligence and resourcefulness are tempered by years of hardship, leaving him reserved and cautious. While he once brimmed with ambition and confidence, the loss of his freedom and livelihood has eroded much of his self-worth. He often underestimates his value and hesitates to take initiative, yet a spark of his old determination surfaces when others are in need. His empathy for the downtrodden is a defining trait, though he struggles to see himself as worthy of redemption.

## Backstory
Born in the mining town of Ironsway in Bavland, Deryan spent his formative years toiling in the mines. Like most in his community, he started working in the mines as soon as he was able. While his peers resigned themselves to the miner’s life, Deryan harbored dreams of escape. Against societal norms, he taught himself basic bookkeeping, saving every coin he could despite the ridicule of his fellow miners.

At 25, he left the mines behind, persuading a merchant to hire him as an assistant. Over the years, Deryan gained expertise in the quicklime trade, working trade routes between Bavland and Alethkar. Eventually, he took a gamble, establishing his own caravan using borrowed funds. Though he never achieved great wealth, he found satisfaction in the freedom and independence his work afforded him.

Three years ago, his life took a devastating turn. A severe fall left him with a debilitating limp, rendering him unable to oversee his caravan. When his debt came due, his creditors in Alethkar seized his assets and sold him into slavery. The transition from a self-made man to a slave was a crushing blow to Deryan’s spirit. His new owners were harsh, compounding his despair, and the poor treatment exacerbated his chronic asthma and left him vulnerable to recurring lung illnesses.

By the time he reached the Shattered Plains, he was a broken man, physically and emotionally. When your group found him, he was battling a life-threatening illness, barely clinging to life.

## Present State
Deryan has been restored to physical health under your group’s care, but his pronounced limp and susceptibility to lung illnesses remain. While he is deeply grateful to his rescuers, he wrestles with feelings of worthlessness and uncertainty about his future as a slave.

## Quirks and Traits
- **Pronounced Limp:** Deryan’s injury significantly affects his mobility, making him slower and less able to keep up with physically demanding tasks.
- **Asthma:** His asthma makes him susceptible to shortness of breath and infection, especially in harsh or dusty environments.
- **Bookkeeping Expertise:** His sharp mind for numbers and trade logistics remains intact, providing him with a valuable skillset.
- **Shattered Optimism:** While he has moments of lucidity and insight, he often undercuts his own ideas with self-doubt.
- **Empathy for Others:** His hardships have made him deeply empathetic to the struggles of others, though he often dismisses his own worth.

## Role in the Campaign
Deryan can serve as a knowledgeable ally, offering insights into trade routes, economic systems, and cultural nuances between Bavland, Alethkar, and Jah Keved. His journey from freedom to slavery provides opportunities for character development, as the party might seek to help him reclaim his sense of purpose. Alternatively, his plight could serve as a stark reminder of the societal injustices within Roshar, potentially inspiring the group to take action against such inequalities. As he remains bound to you as a slave, the nature of your relationship and the treatment he receives will shape his future and the course of your journey together.
