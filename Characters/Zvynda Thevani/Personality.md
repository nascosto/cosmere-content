# Zvynda Thevani's Personality

**Intellectually Driven but Restless:** She has a genuine love of learning and discovery, but struggles to stick with slow, methodical approaches. She gets energized by new ideas and connections between concepts, but can lose interest in the detailed follow-through.

**Socially Capable but Impatient:** She knows the rules of polite society and negotiation from her upbringing, but her eagerness often shows through despite her best efforts. She's the type who maintains proper etiquette while drumming her fingers under the table.

**Idealistic with Practical Roots:** Her merchant background gave her a realistic understanding of how the world works, but her experiences with knowledge hoarding have sparked a growing idealism about how things *should* work. She's caught between pragmatism and principle.

**Perceptive and Suspicious:** Years of travel taught her to read people and situations quickly. She's good at spotting when someone is hiding something or when institutions aren't what they seem, but this can make her overly distrustful of legitimate authority.

**Confident but Frustrated:** Her background and abilities give her genuine self-assurance, but repeated encounters with gatekeeping have left her with a chip on her shoulder. She expects to be taken seriously and gets visibly annoyed when she isn't.

**Curious to a Fault:** She asks probing questions even when it might be wiser to wait, and her fascination with secrets can override her sense of caution.

**Overall Impression:** She'd come across as intelligent, well-educated, and passionate about her interests, but also someone who's clearly carrying some frustration and hasn't quite learned to mask her impatience as well as she thinks she has.
