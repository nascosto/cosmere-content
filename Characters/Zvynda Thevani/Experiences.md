Here are both condensed experiences introducing Zvynda to her mistspren:

## Experience 1: The Decision to Expose

Zvynda walked the darkened corridors toward her quarters, mind reeling from what the interrogation had revealed. The Sons of Honor's campaign to discredit Brightlady Eliah Matal's father wasn't just politics - it was positioning to replace him with their own agent. And that was before their horrific experiments forcing parshmen to transform into voidbringers.

As she turned a corner, prismatic light suddenly danced across the stone wall - shifting blues and golds moving independently of any light source. She looked for a fabrial casting the refraction but found nothing. The pattern pulsed gently, almost urgently.

*Eliah doesn't know how deep this goes,* she thought, watching the strange lights flicker. *Her research position, her father's reputation - all manipulated by these monsters. People need to know what the Sons of Honor really are.*

The prismatic shimmer brightened as if responding to her resolve, then faded as she continued to her room. That night, she began planning how to expose the conspiracy without putting Eliah or her father in greater danger.

## Experience 2: The Half-Shard Revelation

Late that evening, Zvynda studied the half-shard shield designs by lamplight. The Jah Keved fabrial mounted on the shield's back could strengthen it enough to block Shardblade strikes. The designs had been stolen from Jah Keved, acquired through Jamari's contacts with Herdazians who wanted to keep them from Alethi hands. Her price for helping acquire them: a copy to study, with time restrictions to avoid suspicion.

As she traced the circuitry, prismatic light began dancing across the parchment, highlighting key components. Suddenly she could see beyond the military application - the same augmentation principles could strengthen ship hulls, building foundations, tools, anything.

*These could protect so many people,* she realized. *Thaylen ships could weather killing storms. My father's connections could get these to craftsmen who'd see the possibilities, not just weapons of war.*

The light patterns swirled intensely, casting rainbow fragments across her hands and the designs. She looked toward her window but found no source for the refraction.

When the lights faded, her resolve remained crystal clear. She began drafting a coded letter to her father about a "structural enhancement technique" that could revolutionize Thaylen shipbuilding. The Herdazians wanted to deny this to the Alethi, but they'd said nothing about sharing it with those who would use it to protect lives rather than wage wars.

*In both moments, the mistspren responds to Zvynda's commitment to exposing dangerous truths and sharing knowledge that could save lives, even at personal risk.*
