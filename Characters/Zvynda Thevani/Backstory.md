# Zvynda Thevani's Backstory

## Family Background and Early Travels

Zvynda Thevani is a young adult from a small, but established Thaylen merchant house - her family's wealth would place her at the equivalent of 6th or 7th dahn if she were Alethi. Her mother died when she was young, and with her father owning his own merchant ship and no other family to care for her, she spent many years traveling with him across Roshar. This upbringing gave her a comfortable background, though her unconventional childhood didn't make her fit perfectly with traditional high society. She remains fairly versed in social protocols since her father worked with nobility, but her seafaring experiences set her apart from typical lighteyes.

Her father specialized in *cultural arbitrage* - moving legitimately valuable goods between societies that prized them differently. He dealt in Azish silk that Alethi lighteyes coveted, rare Thaylen-cut gemstones that Veden nobles collected, and authentic Horneater pottery that commanded premium prices in Jah Keved. His real skill was understanding which Vorin texts were considered mundane scholarship in one kingdom but cutting-edge research in another, or which spices were common in the Reshi Isles but worth their weight in emeralds in inland cities.

His reputation for discretion and cultural knowledge made him welcome at courts across Roshar. Brightlords trusted him to source gifts that would impress foreign dignitaries. Scholarly ardents relied on him to acquire texts their own libraries lacked. Wealthy merchants' wives commissioned him to find fashions from distant lands. He became a bridge between high societies - someone who understood protocol in multiple kingdoms and could navigate complex social situations while conducting business.

The closest he came to sensitive dealings was moving items that were politically delicate but not illegal - perhaps Alethi wines during trade tensions, or historical texts about territorial disputes. Sometimes he'd quietly move family heirlooms during political upheavals, helping noble families preserve their heritage when borders shifted.

## Learning and Development

**On the Ship:**
The crew became Zvynda's practical teachers. The ship's weaponmaster taught her swordplay during calm weather, while the navigator showed her star charts and navigation techniques. But her most influential mentor was Korim, an aging sailor who'd once been a scribal assistant before fleeing to sea after a political scandal. Korim taught her to quickly assess historical artifacts and documents they encountered in ports, showing her how to spot authentic pieces versus clever forgeries - skills that proved invaluable as her father's business grew more sophisticated.

**In Various Locations:**
Each port offered new archives, ruins, and scholars to learn from. Zvynda developed an eye for historical patterns and, more tellingly, for deliberate gaps in records. She began noticing how certain topics made scholars uncomfortable, how some knowledge seemed to stop at arbitrary boundaries, and how the same influential names appeared across different contexts. Her growing awareness of these hidden networks fueled her conviction that important knowledge was being deliberately controlled.

Through her father's work with high society, she witnessed brightlords using "private knowledge" about trade routes to bankrupt rivals, or leveraging family secrets to force political alliances. She even encountered criminal organizations that operated remarkably similarly to political elite - both using information networks and secrets to maintain power through control rather than merit.

## Philosophy on Knowledge

Zvynda grew up understanding the practical value of exclusive knowledge - she watched her father succeed because he knew which ports had the best prices, which nobles collected what artifacts, and which trade routes others hadn't discovered. She respects that businesses need advantages to thrive and that negotiation requires information leverage. What bothers her isn't *competitive* secrets, but *hoarded* knowledge that could benefit everyone.

During her travels, she began noticing troubling patterns: knowledge that started as reasonable business advantages eventually became tools of control. She saw guild masters who began by protecting legitimate trade secrets but ended up suppressing innovations that could help common people. Ardents who started by preserving dangerous texts but now restricted even basic historical information. She witnessed a brightlord who used his exclusive knowledge of shipping routes to systematically destroy competing merchants, not through better service but by manipulating information access.

**Her Current Mindset:**
Zvynda believes in *fair competition* - if someone discovers a better fabrial technique through hard work and research, they deserve to profit from it. But she's increasingly uncomfortable with how knowledge gets locked away permanently, especially when it could solve real problems. She's learned to distinguish between legitimate business advantages and manipulative power games. When knowledge creates better products or opportunities, she sees it as fair. When it's weaponized to destroy competitors, control populations, or maintain unfair hierarchies, it crosses a line.

**Her Internal Conflict:**
Part of her respects the negotiating lessons her father taught her and his skill at navigating complex power structures. But she's increasingly uncomfortable with how similar "respectable" politics can be to outright criminal enterprises - both using secrets as tools of control rather than means of genuine improvement. She's still working through where the line should be drawn, but she's moving toward believing that knowledge hoarding is fundamentally corrupting, even when it starts with good intentions.

## The Fabrial Obsession

During her travels, Zvynda heard persistent legends about Stormseat and other ancient sites on the Shattered Plains that supposedly housed incredible fabrial workshops. Combined with her exposure to how various groups hoarded knowledge, she became convinced that fabrial capabilities were being artificially limited. The more she learned about current fabrial techniques, the more she suspected that the lack of knowledge sharing between artificers and guilds was preventing the kind of collaborative progress that could advance the field significantly.

## Joining the Vritzl Guild

Expecting to dive into fabrial theory and research, Zvynda found herself assigned to metalwork and basic device assembly - skilled work, but nothing that revealed how fabrials actually functioned or why certain design choices were made. When she asked about theoretical principles, she was told such knowledge came only after years of "proving herself" with foundational tasks. She realized the guild used knowledge itself as a tool of control, doling out understanding to maintain hierarchy rather than advance the craft.

Her frustration with these restrictions, combined with her traveler's restlessness after a few years in one place and the knowledge that accomplished artifabrians worked on the Shattered Plains, eventually drove her to seek new opportunities where she might find both advancement and the intellectual freedom she craved.

## Connection to the Shattered Plains

During their travels, Zvynda's father had developed a business relationship with Brightlord Restares Sadeas, a cousin of Highprince Sadeas who managed some of the family's external trade interests. Restares regularly commissioned Zvynda's father to source luxury goods and cultural items that maintained the family's prestige. When Zvynda expressed her desire to study on the Shattered Plains, her father approached Restares about potential opportunities. It happened that Brightlady Eliah Matal, who conducted archaeological research for the camp, had mentioned needing an assistant with broader cultural knowledge. Restares arranged the wardship, seeing an opportunity to place someone reliable in a position that could benefit the camp's scholarly reputation. While archaeology didn't perfectly align with Zvynda's reasons for going to the plains, she saw it as an opportunity to get there and hopefully make the connections she needed. If the archaeological work led to discovering lost knowledge, even better.

## Purpose and Obstacle

**Purpose: "To discover the truths others would keep hidden"**

This purpose captures Zvynda's core driving force - she's not just seeking knowledge for its own sake, but specifically pursuing the knowledge that powerful people don't want discovered. Her travels showed her how much understanding is deliberately obscured, from fabrial capabilities to historical records to political machinations. What makes this purpose compelling is that it acknowledges the adversarial nature of her quest - she's actively working against those who benefit from ignorance and secrecy. The purpose reflects her growing moral conviction that hidden knowledge often represents injustice, and it's not enough for her to simply learn - she needs to uncover what's being concealed and understand why it's being hidden.

**Obstacle: Impatience**

Zvynda's impatience runs deeper than simple eagerness - it's become her defining flaw after years of watching knowledge being deliberately withheld. Her time with the Vritzl guild has left her hypersensitive to what she perceives as stalling tactics or gatekeeping. Her father's lessons in negotiation mean she *knows* the proper way to handle situations and understands the value of patience and gradual trust-building. But knowing and doing are different things - her impatience creates internal tension where she's constantly fighting against her own better judgment. She might maintain polite conversation while her body language screams frustration, follow proper protocols while obviously rushing through them, or push for meetings to happen sooner than appropriate. She frequently catches herself being impatient and tries to course-correct, sometimes overcompensating and making her seem inconsistent. The result is someone who appears more socially skilled than she actually is in practice, because her impatience undermines the very techniques she knows she should use.
